"Ascension" is one of the finest weapons created at the Great Foundry, the home of the Believers of the Source. It is one of three weapons called the "Triad of Tests," including the hammer "Reason" and the dagger "Enlightenment." The symbol of the faction is engraved on the axe head, and the edges of the blades are so sharp they could split a hair lengthwise. You are the first to bear this weapon.~

This odd axe is so garishly painted and unwieldy that it couldn't possibly be used in combat. The blades of the axe seemed to have been purposely filed down and made blunt possibly to keep the wielder from hurting himself and those around him. More than likely this axe was created for ceremony or better yet as an accouterment for some fools costume.~

The person who created this axe must have been mad or a genius. Only the most skilled of smiths could have forged a weapon using Chaos Matter, the most unstable and unpredictable element in all the planes.

Stories of this particular axe have been told and retold across the planes. Heroic deeds of men defeating creatures of immense power simply by touching the axe to the creature... and of these same men dying horrible deaths while doing simple everyday tasks.

Zaknar the Simple - Defeated a devourer with a single swipe of this axe. Crushed to death by a falling boulder in the vast plains of Tabor.

Garkon the Righteous - Struck by a mysterious discharge of energy while fighting a cranium rat.

Kannas - Tradesman by profession. Buried alive as the stone wall the axe was mounted on collapsed on him.

Kvry Matterson - A child of only nine seasons, was not only able to ward off a group of marauding fire bats, he even managed to kill 2 of them!

The list of tragedies and deeds goes on and on.~

This magnificent axe, known as "Blindsider," is truly one of a kind. It is rumored that it was the creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an ancient empire on the Prime Material Plane. The Emperor whom Yar served, a vain and wicked man, commissioned the creation of "a weapon of unsurpassed beauty." After years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor with "Blindsider," whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work could never be reproduced. 

The various ores and enchantments employed in the forging of this weapon yielded a new type of metal that is lightweight, durable, and highly reflective. The axe earned its name from its tendency to reflect light into the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that its wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted immunity to blinding attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature.~

This giant, axe-like cleaver earned its nickname while in the hands of Oswell Breck, a butcher who once serviced the Clerk's Ward of Sigil. The chant is that one day this affable and well-respected citizen suddenly went on a murderous and bloody rampage that lasted ten days and ten nights. Cleaver in hand, Oswell stalked the streets of the ward, brutally hacking down every man, woman, and child unlucky enough to cross his path until the Lady herself intervened. It is rumored that he suffered from a strange disease that slowly caused his body to waste away, and it was this disease that eroded his sanity and prompted the murder spree.

The origin of this instrument of carnage is shrouded in mystery. However, the various wizards and scholars who examined the discarded weapon after Oswell's mazing have catalogued the nature of its enchantment. The cleaver seems to feed upon its victims, sucking the very life force from them and bestowing a portion of it upon its wielder.~

When its powers are awakened and its name known, "Edge of Oblivion" becomes entirely black... where once just the edges were ebony, now the blackness has spread across the entire blade. The unease the blade radiates has increased ten-fold, so much so that it is uncomfortable to hold it for too long.

"Edge of Oblivion" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an opponent... for every wound it causes, it also disintegrates the flesh around the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the wound as it strikes. 

There is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow been encaged within the axe itself, but again this is only speculation. Given that the planes are infinite, anything is possible.~

It is not exactly clear in the annals of known planar history when "Hatred's Gift" was created, but by the bloody trail it has left across the planes seems to have finally reached you. 

The axe exists to inspire hatred in one's enemies and fill its wielder with a berserker rage. When entering combat, the skulls along the shaft come alive, chittering their teeth, and the teeth (remnants of fiendish victims absorbed into the axe blade) extend outwards, biting and tearing into opponents with each strike. 

Once equipped, "Hatred's Gift" cannot be dropped unless its curse is removed.~

A single teardrop of the wielder's blood, applied at the border where the axe meets the handle, is sufficient to awaken "Heartgrinder." Once applied, the drop of blood freckles across the blade and handle, giving it a dull red radiance. The glow from Heartgrinder pulses, matching the heartbeat of its wielder.

No matter what the target, Heartgrinder is a powerful weapon, capable of tearing through nearly any defenses. Against targets with blood running in their veins (whether their own or another's - vampires beware), Heartgrinder inflicts additional damage, as every stroke also smashes the target's heart, no matter what location the axe struck.~

The final achievement of one Kaarlac Cragenmoor, this enchanted knife is a boon to those who practice the mystic arts. Kaarlac, ever one to aspire to greatness, sought to create a magic item that could retain an imprint of a portion of his memory - particularly the short term memory that contained his considerable spell repertoire. He theorized that, if successful, he could effectively double the amount of spell knowledge he could retain at any given time. Unfortunately, the enchantment was beyond his capability and in the midst of his fervent casting, Kaarlac went mad and plunged the knife into his own chest. His sacrifice, however, was not in vain, for the knife possesses enough of the intended enchantment to bestow upon its wielder the ability to memorize twice the number of first level spells.~

Years of being embedded in the flesh of a fiend have imbued this once ordinary dagger with qualities best left with their kind. Blood of the fiend has infused itself with the dagger causing it to feel slightly warm to the touch.

These gauntlets have had many names over the centuries. Some have termed the gauntlets the "Gauntlets of Hunger." Other terms have ranged from "Gloves of Greed," or, among the stupidest, "the Gnashing Gloves." The githzerai called them "they-which-devour," and believed them to be an artifact fashioned by the slaadi, the intelligent carnivorous frog-like beings that inhabit the plane of Limbo.

The most common name for this item is the "Gauntlets of Teeth." The exact creature from which the bones originate from is unknown. Nonetheless, when the nature of the gloves is revealed, their power awakens as soon as they are used in combat. When the user punches an enemy, the bone exteriors of the gloves peel back to reveal several rows of teeth. These teeth sink greedily into the foe's body. These teeth are not jagged - they are mostly wide and blunt, but they clamp onto a target with the strength of a giant, doing additional crushing damage when punching an opponent.~

This type of weapon, thought to be forged by the flames of the Elemental Plane of Fire, is extremely rare, even in Sigil. The elemental properties of the hammer grants its wielder an increased resistance to fire and fire-based attacks. In addition, when used in combat, the hammer deals out additional damage when it successfully connects, searing its target with crackling flames.~

This war hammer has a huge stone head in the shape of a rectangular block. Faint traces of gore and blood are on all sides of the hammer's head. The shaft is of a thick wood that looks too weak to support the hammer head's weight.

This enchanted hammer was used as a tool by the Athar at one time during their religious persecution phase of their faction history. The magical war-hammer "Foolsmiter" was constructed so that it did additional damage against opponents who were particularly stupid. When it was crafted, however, the enchantment was twisted such that if the user was less intelligent than the target struck by the hammer, the wielder would take damage as well. For many years, the hammer became a test rite between rival members of the Athar as a primitive (and lethal) IQ test. It was stolen from their headquarters in the Shattered Temple many years ago and has resurfaced once or twice across the planes.

It is believed that the Intelligence vs. Intelligence contest the hammer once inflicted on the wielder and his enemies has dissipated from the hammer over time, but no one has been confident enough to put it to the test.~

Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal sledgehammer, this war hammer (also called "The Hammer of Comminution") delivers a devastating strike that not only inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, inflicting extra damage... and if the victim survives, it also "softens" him up for the next attack. 

The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U. A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he struck with the hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate.~

This mace looks much like any other mace - a spiked ball atop a wooden shaft, a leather handgrip, a thong to prevent losing it in the heat of battle - except for the Eye etched on the head of the weapon. This weapon is The Justifier, a mace created in the city of Heliopolis by disciples of the god Horus to maim the followers of evil. An intelligent weapon several centuries old, the Justifier is more than happy to offer its opinions on various matters. 

While the Justifier is usually good-natured, it will erupt in anger if it notices evil creatures nearby. When this happens, it attempts to possess its wielder and compel them to attack nearby creatures indiscriminately. It is usually apologetic afterwards, but will resist attempts to stop wielding it nonetheless.~

Cleverly designed, this object splits into two pieces to form punch daggers. When properly used they are deadly in combat.

Although excellent as a combat weapon, those same mechanisms used to shred the flesh of an enemy can also be used for the delicate procedures of opening locks and disarming traps.

Only the most gifted of thieves possess items such as this. As it takes a keen mind and skilled hands to properly operate.~

These daggers were once wielded by Moorin, the jinxed. Moorin was a hapless young woman who became a thief through a series of disasters. Each of these "accidents" resulted in the death of the trainer for whatever profession she chose. Out of desperation Moorin trained herself in the art of Thievery with laughable results.

Moorin's thieving career was filled with numerous mishaps that involved her in combat situations. Each such combat often ended with Moorin being seriously wounded and thrown into prison. When it became obvious that Moorin was not long for this world her father, Arch-mage Xoorcon, created these magical blades for her use.

With the luck provided by her new blades Moorin was actually able to successfully strike an opponent in combat (which came as a shock to her). While her opponent was busy bleeding, Moorin would make good her escape. Unfortunately, during one such escape, Moorin tripped, fell on her dagger and died before she could staunch the bleeding from her wounds.

^NNOTE: The main effects of luck are a bonus to hit, an increase in outgoing minimum damage, and a decrease in incoming maximum damage. Luck also offers smaller bonuses to certain Thief skills and initative rolls.~

To further her goal she commissioned the creation of these blades by the mage Thex Voorton. With her new weapons in hand she was quite successful at her craft. 

Shar met her demise when she was hired to assassinate the very mage who created the daggers. Much to her surprise the weapons failed to harm their creator, Thex, nor did they grant Shar protection against his spells...~

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias has left to remind him of the Upper Planes. This heavy blade is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the blade. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the sword seems to be burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the blade is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver.

The sword looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat. 

^NNOTE: Celestial Fire can be transformed into a weapon type (axe, club, dagger, gauntlets, hammer) of your choosing via interaction. Be aware that this choice is permanent.-

When swung, the dagger flows like molten metal around your hands, which them smash into your foes with great force.  

It looks to be made of iron, silver, and any of a number of different metals. Sometimes they blend together, other times, they submerge into the core of the blade, only to resurface again minutes later.~

This strange item was in your possession after you gave the Modron Cube to the iron golem in the Siege Tower. It looks to be a small dagger, but its surface twists and bends as you watch, as if struggling to break free from its shape. When swung, the dagger erupts into a wicked looking club, slapping the target with immense force before shifting back into a blade. 

It looks to be made of iron, silver, and any of a number of different metals. Sometimes they blend together, other times, they submerge into the core of the blade, only to resurface again minutes later.~

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap itself.  

The skull is not human. For one thing, it has stubs where horns used to be (and looked as if they were gnawn off - teeth marks are visible around the edges) and second of all, the ridges of needle-like teeth that are part of the jaw don't belong to any human you have ever seen. If you were to hazard a guess, the entire skull looks faintly reptilian.~

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap itself.  

The "metal" is not metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm that punched through the base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the head of this weapon. The spikes that have pierced through the skull actually appear to be some sort of quills from the creature's forearm.

When this weapon is used in combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a creature's skin, acid oozes from the quills into the target, doing additional damage. This acid also burns the hands of the user, doing some damage to the wielder every time he strikes someone else.

The common name of this weapon is "Devil's Due." To who or what event it refers to is unknown, but it was obviously a painful experience for the two parties involved.~

This feather is ash-gray, fading to black around the edges. It is much larger than a bird feather, and it creates an unpleasant tingling sensation when held for more than a minute.

Examination of the feather reveals that is the feather from a Vrock, one of the many races of tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The Vrock resemble huge vultures, and they are often used as scouts for the tanar'ri forces in the Blood War.

This particular feather is believed to have been taken from a Vrock shaman, who is reported to have died by simply disbelieving himself. Possessed of a certain mental imbalance and with an odious habit of devouring his followers to gain strength, this barmy Vrock was rumored to be capable of causing others of his flock to behave erratically - much more so than for a normal tanar'ri. He convinced many of his flock to tear off their wings and take up burrowing in the ground. Other times, he preached the virtues of honesty as being more evil and destructive than any lie. When he disintegrated, only the feather was left behind as testament to his fevered existence. Some of the shaman's residue is believed to reside in this "Chaos Feather."

The Chaos Feather, when used in combat as a dagger, inflicts a minor amount of damage (about the same as a conventional dagger) and has the power to confuse any target it strikes. Creatures struck by the feather may be stunned, run away, or attack their allies.

Most tanar'ri consider the feather to be a sacred object. Vrocks will kill anyone possessing it in order to retrieve it.~

This small dagger looks fragile, but a series of jagged teeth line the edge of the blade. The hilt itself is covered with dried blood, most likely the blood of the users who held the weapon and were unable to release their grip.

Research indicates that this cursed dagger has had many names, the most prominent of which was "Last Resort." When equipped, the user cannot release the grip until death, or until the curse is lifted by spell or divine intervention. The dagger is rumored to be able to hurt almost any creature it strikes, no matter what the creature's plane of origin or its defenses. One planewalker who had freed herself from its curse actually chose to travel with it, figuring that in any instance where she *had* to use it couldn't be worsened by having it in her possession.~

These leather gloves give the user the ability to use his hands like claws. When the wearer attacks a foe with his hands, long black talons lance forth from the fingers of the gauntlets and allow the user to rake an opponent for additional slashing damage. When the wearer is not attacking, the talons recede back into the gauntlets... although they seem to do so reluctantly.

Closer examination of the weapon reveals a strange symbol, very faint, on the surface of the axe head. Tracing it with your finger, there is a sudden charge, and the axe head changes before your eyes into a silvery-looking metal.

The edge is incredibly sharp, so much so it looks like it could hack through stone if necessary. The symbol you traced on the weapon is now glowing brilliantly, and if anything, the axe has become even lighter than before, so much so that you can almost wield it one-handed.~

^NNOTE: To use the prybar to force a locked door or chest, select it as a weapon then "attack" the container or door you wish to pry open. Although the prybar is specifically intended for such use, you can attempt to bash open a container or door with *any* weapon, including your fists.~

Rows and rows of minute skulls line the outer edge of this bracelet. It is crowned by an over-sized skull with fire-red gems that serves as its eyes. This bracelet is the physical manifestation of the suffering of the tormented slaves of Dahnthur. It was their ultimate wish to gain protection from their oppressors, and with this magical bracelet, their wish was finally realized. Even with the fiery red gems, a royal purple hue continually emanates outward.~

This item is constructed out of long strings of black iron interwoven together to form a bracelet of sorts. Sharp spikes protrude along the outside as well as the inside of the band. It would seem the person wearing this would be subjected to excruciating amounts of pain.~

Legend has it that this bracelet was created by Nacek the Sadistic. Tiny razor sharp spikes cover the entire surface of this item injecting small amounts of rare reagents into the blood stream of the user.

This ropy mass of bloody intestines is yours; Ravel pulled them quickly and painlessly out of your body when she reverted to Marta during your conversation in the Black-Barbed Maze. The fluids surrounding these intestines have congealed into a slick resin, and holding them is like holding a dry, rubbery cord. You have to admit it makes you uncomfortable to see them outside of your body.

Ravel... Marta... WHOEVER that insane hag was... mentioned that these intestines would serve as a powerful charm, but you have no idea how they could be used.~

The fluids surrounding these intestines have congealed into a slick resin, and holding them is like holding a dry, rubbery cord. You have to admit it makes you uncomfortable to see them outside of your body.

Ravel... Marta... WHOEVER that insane hag was... mentioned that these intestines would serve as a powerful charm; it looks like when they are wrapped around one's wrist like a phylactery, they give the wearer a portion of your immortal endurance, increasing the person's endurance and granting them a supernatural healing rate. 

You have to confess, however, no matter what blessing these intestines bestow, they look pretty damn gross when worn as a bracelet.~

Considered standard equipment for any adventuring mage, bracelets such as these can be found across the planes. Judging by the markings on this particular bracelet it appears to have been made in a style quite common to Sigil. Various glyphs of warding are meticulously carved along the surface producing an almost hypnotic effect when looked at. When worn this bracelet protects the wearer from normal attacks as if they were wearing scale armor.~

This strange charm of woven rat tails was made by Barking-Wilder, and it has been infused with some of his chaotic spirit. When worn, it helps the wearer shrug off physical attacks and gives him an insane rush of strength and energy (but reduces the wearer's wisdom accordingly).~

This set of earrings is fashioned to resemble the four symbols of the Revolutionary League. They are designed to aid the Anarchist in his pursuit of freedom for all. Note that these earrings, while useful, are not exactly subtle in declaring allegiance to the Revolutionary League. These particular earrings makes you more attractive, more persuasive, and better able to infiltrate the strongholds of the overweening power structure while also providing a clear mind against potentially terrifying situations.~ 

@3030 = ~Crimson Sphere Earring~ 
@3031 = ~CRIMSON SPHERE EARRING

This thin earring has a small red gem set into its end. It glows slightly, as if a small fire burns inside it, but it is otherwise cold to the touch.~

Special:

   +25% Magical Fire Resistance
Weight: 0

This small red gem set into this earring acts like a heat sponge, protecting the wearer from heat or flame attacks. Whenever the wearer is exposed to fire, the gem draws some of the heat into itself, shielding its wearer from part of the damage.

It is rumored that each of these earrings holds a tiny fire mephit inside, and that they are so starved for heat that they will drink deep of any fire in the vicinity. This has never been proven, mostly because no one really cares to investigate the matter.~

Usable only by Dustmen

This earring has the smell of ash and dust about it and is icy cold to the touch. When worn, the earring shields the wearer from temperature extremes, granting the wearer partial resistance to heat and cold. Furthermore, the earring also protects the wearer from mind-influencing magics and magics that attack the body, including paralyzation and death magic.

The earring signifies the wearer's allegiance to the Dustmen and can only be worn by a member of the Dustman faction. According to rumor, this earring helps dull the Dustmen to the effects of the outside world.~

@3036 = ~INDEP EARRING
Special:

   Immunity to confusion
Weight: 0
Usable only by Indeps

This barbed earring marks the wearer as a member of the Indep faction. This earring is the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect him from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of harm's way... the tiny counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its mere presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and confusion effects.

Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted "free spirits" to the metal and caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earring by any means; from what scholars have determined, there is something about the earring that the spirits find "cozy."~

This small earring is made from polished obsidian. Despite the smoothness of its surface, it reflects no light whatsoever.

Commonly referred to as "a rogue's best friend," the black gem this earring is made from possesses magical properties that absorb light, making it easier for its wearer to move undetected in the shadows.~

@3042 = ~Stinger Earring~ 
@3043 = ~SEGMENTED EARRING 
Weight: 0

This earring has been made from the hardened shell of a segmented, larva-like creature. Its shell has been treated with some sort of glazed finish that makes it look disturbingly alive. The wire that hooks to the ear looks like it is part of the larva itself, perhaps its stinger or antenna.~ 
@3044 = ~STINGER EARRING 
Special:

This earring has been made from the hardened shell of a segmented, larva-like creature. Its shell has been treated with some sort of glazed finish that makes it look disturbingly alive. The wire that hooks to the ear looks like it is part of the larva itself, perhaps its stinger or antenna.

To activate the earring's power, the wearer must prick his thumb with the stinger, allowing it to bond with its new owner. When "awakened," this earring helps protect the wearer from attacks, giving the wearer's skin the same strength and durability of the larva's shell.~ 

@3045 = ~Glass Eye~

Special:
   +20% Slashing Resistance
   +20% Piercing Resistance
   -10% Crushing Resistance
   -10% Missile Resistance
Weight: 0

At first glance, this glass eye seems a poor replacement for a real one. However, when inserted into an empty eye socket facing inwards, its power awakens. 

Although the eye dulls the wearer to colors and sights, it also seems to soften his perception of angles and shapes, granting resistance to sharp and pointed weapons. Unfortunately for the wearer, this rounding of edges also causes them to take increased damage from blunt objects.~

Special: 
   Immunity to Chromatic Orb
   +10% Elemental Resistance
   +10% Magic Resistance
Weight: 0
Usable only by Good creatures

This shimmering jewel is actually the corpse of a radiance spirit from the Upper Plane of Elysium. When these creatures pass away, they leave their shimmering husks behind. These husks are often mistaken for jewels or semi-precious stones. Their essence is still that of harmony and goodness, and they can only be employed by a creature whose heart is filled with good intentions.

When placed in the owner's eye socket, the eye grafts itself to the wearer's skull and helps shield its new owner. It absorbs a portion of the energies from incoming attacks and provides proof against all manner of magical attacks.~

@3055 = ~The Fiendish Eye of Kalem'Darr~ 
@3056 = ~FIENDISH EYE

This slitted red eyeball makes you uncomfortable just looking at it. It looks like it was taken from some huge reptile... and it's still moist, as if it was just taken from the unfortunate creature's socket.~

@3057 = ~THE FIENDISH EYE OF KALEM'DARR
(Minor Artifact)
Special:
   +1 Charisma
   +1 Luck
   -10% Experience Gained
Weight: 0

A well-known and respected fiend from the Lower Planes, Kalem'Darr was a member of the Fated faction in Sigil. His businesses were spread far and wide, and it was said he had a glittering touch, for every enterprise he undertook was successful. He planned carefully, took few risks, and prospered. Occasionally, he was forced to collect on debts - which could be bloody undertakings, but in the end, he always received his payments.

One day, one of his debtors came to Kalem'Darr and told him he could not settle his debt with coin... but would provide something of greater worth, if the fiend was interested. The man was a hedge wizard of little power, but he claimed he knew the ways of blessing a businessman's eye so that no opportunity would ever escape his sight. Kalem'Darr, both greedy and intrigued, agreed to accept the enchantment as payment.

It worked... too well, as perhaps the wizard had intended.

Kalem'Darr's enchanted eye soon saw opportunities *everywhere.* Too many to be exploited, and many others the fiend did not know HOW to take advantage of. What his "blessed" eye saw, his hands made broken - every opportunity he tried to take advantage of, his ineptitude mangled. His businesses fell apart, his financial empire crumbled. He soon found himself in debt to his fellows, who had little sympathy for their former competitor.

Kalem'Darr, unable to bear his reversal of fortune, finally plucked the offending eyeball from his socket and placed it within a cube of glass upon his mantle-piece. Then one day... the eye simply vanished.

It is said the eyeball itself saw a better opportunity as a free agent, but this has never been proven.

When placed within an empty eye socket, not only does the fiendish eye grant the wearer a trace of Kalem'Darr's fiendish immunities, it also grants the wearer a bonus to their dealings with others, allowing them to thread their way through a conversation and take what they need. Still, the blinding array of opportunities the eye presents to the wearer blinds him to the opportunities he does take, reducing how much he learns from his experiences.

^NNOTE: The main effects of luck are a bonus to hit, an increase in outgoing minimum damage, and a decrease in incoming maximum damage. Luck also offers smaller bonuses to certain Thief skills and initative rolls.

^NNOTE: Due to the way the game handles Experience bonuses, removing this eye will also restore any experience lost as a result of wearing it.~

Usable only by Chaotic creatures 

This is a gift you received from Adahn when you bid him farewell in the Smoldering Corpse Bar. It's a featureless metal ring that looks extremely thick and heavy, but it is almost weightless. It shifts as you watch, changing from silver, to bronze, to gold.

^NNOTE: The main effects of luck are a bonus to hit, an increase in outgoing minimum damage, and a decrease in incoming maximum damage. Luck also offers smaller bonuses to certain Thief skills and initative rolls.~

DISPLACER RING
Special: 
   +1 to Armor Class

Created from the blood of a displacer beast, this ring is able to partially redirect the force of any ordinary weapon. This results in making the user harder to hit and when hit takes less damage than normal.~

@3068 = ~Jagged Ring~ 
@3069 = ~Mempa's Biting Ring~ 
@3070 = ~JAGGED RING
Weight: 0

This glittering, silvery ring is sculpted with dozens of tiny, ornate flanges and decorative protrusions. It looks as if it might be slightly uncomfortable to wear, as a careless bearer might cut themselves upon its jagged edges while placing or removing the ring.~ 
@3071 = ~MEMPA'S BITING RING
*CURSED*
Special: 
   +1 to Armor Class
   +10 Maximum Hit Points 
Weight: 0

Mempa was a mage obsessed with the possibility of having her magic items lost or burgled while she was asleep or otherwise incapacitated. While the vast majority of her carried possessions were inseparable from her corpse and thus buried with her, some of her weaker items - early experiments, perhaps - were left behind and remain in the world of the living.

Mempa's Biting Ring, whose powerful aura protects its bearer from bodily harm, is one such item. However, once placed upon one's finger, the ring bites down and holds on so tenaciously that it is nigh impossible to remove it from the 'bitten' digit.~ 

@3072 = ~Negative Token~ 
@3073 = ~NEGATIVE TOKEN 
Special:
   Protection from Shadows

This is a "negative token": a flat, black disk that appears to have no substance to it at all. Turning it over reveals that it has no third dimension - there is no thickness to this item at all. This ring provides protection against the shadows that stalk you, making it more difficult for them to harm you.

^NNOTE: Protection effects grant a +2 bonus to Armor Class and Saving Throws against the specified creatures. Protection effects do not stack.~ 

@3074 = ~Yevrah's Ring of Almost Invisibility~ 
@3075 = ~YEVRAH'S RING OF ALMOST INVISIBILITY 
Special: 
   +1 to Armor Class
   +10% to Stealth 
Weight: 0

The ring makes its wearer invisible - almost. Sometimes, for brief periods, the wearer becomes really, *really* close to being invisible - an event which is often disconcerting to an attacker - and is thus more difficult to strike in combat.~

This ornate silver ring is set with a single red stone of an unknown type. The ring is believed to have been created by an adventuring mage named Thex. Thex claimed she was tired of sitting back and flinging spells at enemies while the rest of her adventuring party was able to get into the thick of battle. She felt that the ring would allow her to become what she chose to call a Battlemage. The Ring of Thex was the crowning achievement of her short career.~

Among the many secrets of the Society of Sensation is the ability to shape a peculiar stone from Elysium, dubbed "soulstone." While this stone is not as powerful as the sensory stones, the soul stone is said to carry an imprint of the shaper's feelings. These rings are often used in Sensate marriage ceremonies, each ring inscribed with the feelings of the other. This ring was obviously intended for you.~

This twisted branch is actually composed of three black branches that have grown tightly around each other. The branches look much like the ones in Ravel's maze, but the branches have none of the black barbs that covered the trees in her maze.

This black-barbed branch is a wand forged from the trees in Ravel's maze and endowed with a fraction of her magical power.

Annah's vest is similar to leather armor, but it seems more flexible and allows her greater freedom of movement. You're not certain what creature's hide (if any) was used to make the vest, but it seems durable enough. Three straps help secure the front, and a staggered series of bracers run down the left arm. If necessary, Annah can slip her punch daggers into the bracers to conceal them.~

Perhaps the idea that Annah would wear anything solely for ornamental value makes you suspicious of these earrings. Upon closer examination, you discover these thin metal earrings are actually a series of well-crafted lockpicks. If need be, you can unhook them and use them to pick open stubborn locks.

This piece of sturdy leather armor was clearly fashioned for a woman. It is a piece of remarkably skillful craftsmanship; small metal plates and bands are carefully concealed here and there over the jerkin's surface, providing a great deal of protection without hampering mobility. The armor seems best suited for a 'flashy' fighter who would make the full use of the free movement it would afford them. The enchantments woven into it by Goncalves not only serve to protect such a combatant, but aid them in their balance and the striking of their foes, as well.~

This piece of light leather armor was clearly fashioned for a woman. Even at a glance one can tell it is of the highest quality; every part of it, from its supple leather banding to its quadruple-stitched seams and padded silk lining, speaks of impeccable craftsmanship. Goncalves wove a number of enchantments into the lining of the jerkin so that its wearer is more prone to blend into surrounding shadows, enabling them to setup advantageous positions before cutting down their foes.~

Usable only by Dak'kon

Dak'kon's ceremonial *zerth* armor. It is fashioned of interlocking metal rings, formed of the same substance that Dak'kon's blade is made of. (Unlike the blade, however, it does not appear that the armor changes based on the mental state of the wielder.) The armor is worn over a padded red tunic, and spiked bracers and shoulder pads have been added to give greater protection to the arms and upper body.

While Dak'kon's armor is similar to chain mail, it is lighter and more flexible, allowing him to wield his sword more effectively. Furthermore, it seems that when the sword and armor are used in tandem, the armor becomes even more fluid. Whether this is a unique property of *karach,* or whether this is some magical effect of the two items, is unknown.~

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. 

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the edge. Presumably as he gains levels, he may be able to manipulate the blade in new ways. 

It is not known whether all githzerai *zerth* carry such weapons. Certainly a weapon that depends on the integrity of the wielder would be entrusted only to those who had learned to discipline themselves.

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~

This archaic double-bladed battle-axe is reminiscent of an executioner's axe; the axe head has been forged into the symbol of the Mercykiller Faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread... the outstretched wings have been shaped into the blades of the axe). The axe itself is huge; even wielded two-handed, it would require tremendous strength to use effectively. For a spectral entity, Vhailor must be extremely strong.

This axe is as much a part of Vhailor as his armor, and the axe itself carries part of Vhailor's essence within it. As a result, it is utterly devoted to justice and will not allow the user to rest while "judgments" are left to be delivered. The considerable damage it causes to an opponent is further increased if the axe strikes a guilty or chaotic creature. 

The origin of this axe is unknown. If you were to hazard a guess, the axe gained its powers simply from Vhailor's belief. If he were to die a second death, you don't know what would happen to it.~

This suit of armor is part of Vhailor... destroying Vhailor (if such a thing were possible) would most likely result in the destruction of the armor.

Nordom's home plane of Mechanus is driven by great clockwork gears. Tending these gears and making sure they run smoothly are given to creatures called "gear spirits." These gear spirits have the ability to turn themselves into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even crossbows. Nordom's crossbows are two such gear spirits, and they seem to have willingly fled with him from Mechanus. 

Their duties are so essential to the smooth functioning of Mechanus that the modrons have officially assigned these spirits to the various gears. While the gear spirits love the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the modrons rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a result, there are tales of gear spirits that leave the great gears of Mechanus, leaving their duties for a while to sample the planes beyond their own. Most likely, Nordom's two crossbows caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback along with him, peppering any hostile creature they see with crossbow bolts. The gear spirits can make endless supplies of these bolts, so there is never any need for Nordom to reload unless he wishes to fire new crossbow bolts.

The crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling noises. They seem to be talking to each other, but their conversation is indecipherable. They're most likely discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics.~

The bolts vanish after they strike an object or once they reach their maximum range, then they disintegrate.~

The putty-like globes on the heads of these crossbow bolts are actually dried-up aquatic sponges found in many of the great lakes of Bytopia. Seemingly unremarkable to most scholars, these tiny sponges were accidentally discovered to have the property of being able to absorb acids and store them in their bodies with no harm to themselves. 

As a result, great masses of these creatures were gathered and bred for use as weapons against fiends in the Blood War. After being fed a steady diet of acid for a few days, the sponges are harvested, dried, and covered with a resin that keeps a soft bubble around the sponge. The sponge is then mounted on the head of an arrow or crossbow bolt and is ready for use. 

When the tip of the bolt strikes a creature with sufficient force, the resin bubble bursts, the sponge flattens, and the target is doused with acid.~

These enchanted bolts have been fashioned from one of the great cubes of Acheron. According to many planar scholars, Acheron is a plane in perpetual war with itself, where huge cubes the size of continents float through the ether and smash against each other. On the surface of these cubes, legions of soldiers wage war on each other, swarming from cube to cube and attacking whoever else they can find. The plane is filled with the ringing of steel and the great thundering impacts of the cubes striking each other.  

These bolts carry a portion of Acheron's heart within them. When these bolts strike an opponent, they do so with so much force that the impact has the potential to enrage an opponent and cause them to attack recklessly for a period of time.~

Also called "Kessek's Teeth," the head of these enchanted bolts are made of bone and have two long fangs curving out from the center. When one of these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on a life of their own and begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body. 

According to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands who was forced to watch his people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft of Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft because of heavy snows, he sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the province of Ohinru. 

Learning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of Ohinru saw an opportunity to wipe out the "nomadic pests" and claim their lands for their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their heads mounted on the walls so that, "the vultures might feed while the bariaurs starved." 

When the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had died of starvation, Kessek finally learned what had happened to his scouts. Consumed with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of bolts from the teeth and bones of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, he traveled to Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city streets, the name of each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he released each shaft. 

Each bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily searching for a victim and each found one... then another, then another. The night was filled with the choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as the devourers claimed their bodies. 

When dawn touched the city, the vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could be found.

The bolts of Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the planes. It is said that for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt is born... with the same hunger as the first.~

These bolts have somehow captured the deadly harmonic of Pandemonium and then added insult to injury by imprisoning an enraged air elemental inside the head of the bolt.

These crotch-shaped bolts have been enchanted with one thing in mind: emasculation. When fired, they home in on the most vulnerable point on a victim's body, sink into the flesh, then the head of each bolt scissors outwards, making it nearly impossible to pull out and increasing the damage considerably.

These crossbow bolts are the work of a twisted mechanical genius. Just beneath the head of each bolt is a small catch, that when pressed, unlocks the head of the bolt, allowing it to divide. From what you can tell, once the bolts are unlocked, the pyramid-shaped heads are carefully fashioned so that each one splits into three on impact. Each triangle-shaped fragment then tears a different route through the target's body, wreaking havoc on his internal organs.~

Nordom's Crossbows are not the only gear spirits to have fled from Mechanus - Optix, a somewhat older and more curmudgeonly gear spirit, has been living his last few centuries in an alchemy lab in Sigil. When the alchemist passed away, Optix moved on to various odd jobs, including keg taps, cuckoo clocks, metronomes, corkscrews, and so on, never settling very long in one place. His most recent form, that of a sniper scope, seems to content him for now.

Although Optix is an irritating nag to the two younger crossbow gear spirits, he *has* studied the physiology of creatures throughout the planes. The two youngsters grudgingly admit (with reluctant, strained clicks) that his advice on how to aim for the eyes and other vital areas of creatures is quite valuable.

Although it runs contrary to his nature, Optix can actually force itself to be charming to other small mechanical devices... just not for too long. While in Nordom's possession, Optix can be convinced to 'talk' to any locks you encounter and try to persuade them to unlock. 

Another unfortunate aspect of Optix's presence is that once he's "comfortable," he doesn't like to come off. A Remove Curse will be needed to pull him off of Nordom's head if he becomes too irritating.~

This is your charred right index finger; the tip has been snapped off, and the flesh that once surrounded the bone has been turned to ash.

To make matters worse, you notice that your flesh has healed slowly and poorly from the wound... if Ignus were to attack you with a rage, he might be able to muster enough heat and flames that recovering would be difficult... perhaps even destroy you? The thought doesn't please you.

Ignus has hinted that this charred remain of your finger somehow holds a fraction of his infernal power... now passed on to you. To invoke its power, you must slice off your finger again, place this stump there, then let the flesh heal over it.

This is your charred hand; it has been severed at the wrist, and the flesh that once surrounded the bone has been scoured clean, leaving only the stark white bones behind. Despite the lack of muscle and skin, however, the bones of the hand have been fused together so that the bones do not fall apart. The pain of having the hand separated from you was almost more than you could bear, and it left lingering, blackened, scars on your wrists and arm. To make matters worse, you notice that your flesh has healed slowly and poorly from the wound... if Ignus were to attack you with a rage, he might be able to muster enough heat and flames that recovering would be difficult... perhaps even destroy you? The thought doesn't please you. 

Reattaching the fused bones to the stump transferred some traces of Ignus' magic to you. By focusing intently, you can light your own hand ablaze, allowing you to launch fireballs at your enemies. Strangely, this process hurts much less than the original ordeal.~

"*Know* that flesh cannot mark steel. *Know* that steel may mark flesh. In *knowing* this, Zerthimon became free."

"*Know* that the tentacled ones were of flesh. They relied on the flesh and used it as tools for their will. One of the places where flesh served their will were the Fields of Husks on the False Worlds of the *illithids.*"

"The Fields were where the bodies of the People were cast after the *illithids* had consumed their brains. When the brain had been devoured, the husks came to be fertilizer to grow the poison-stemmed grasses of the *illithids.* Zerthimon worked the Fields with no *knowing* of himself or what he had become. He was a tool of flesh, and the flesh was content."

"It was upon these fields that Zerthimon came to *know* the scripture of steel. During one of the turnings, as Zerthimon tilled the Fields with his hands, he came across a husk whose brain remained within it. It has not been used as food. Yet it was dead."

"The thought that one of the husks had died a death without serving as food for the *illithids* was a thought Zerthimon had difficulty understanding. From that thought, came a desire to *know* what had happened to the husk."

"Embedded in the skull of the husk was a steel blade. It had pierced the bone. Zerthimon realized that was what had killed the husk. The steel had marked the flesh, but the flesh had not marked the steel."

"Zerthimon took the blade and studied its surface. In it, he saw his reflection. It was in the reflection of the steel that Zerthimon first *knew* himself. Its edge was sharp, its will the wearer's. It was the blade that would come to be raised against Gith when Zerthimon made the Pronouncement of Two Skies."

"Zerthimon kept the blade for many turnings, and many were the thoughts he had about it. He used it in the fields to aid his work. In using it, he thought about how it was not used."

"The *illithids* were powerful. Zerthimon had believed that there was nothing that they did not *know.* Yet the *illithids* never carried tools of steel. They only used flesh as tools. Everything was done through flesh, for the tentacled ones were made of flesh and they *knew* flesh. Yet steel was superior to flesh. When the blade had killed the husk, it was the flesh that had been weaker than the steel."

"It was then that Zerthimon came to *know* that flesh yielded to steel. In *knowing* that, he came to *know* that steel was stronger than the *illithids.*"

"Steel became the scripture of the People. *Know* that steel is the scripture by which the People came to *know* freedom."

"It came to pass that the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased ordered Zerthimon before him in his many-veined galleria. He claimed that Zerthimon had committed slights of obstinance and cowardice against his partnership. The claim had no weight of truth, for Arlathii only wished to *know* if flames raged within Zerthimon's heart. He wished to *know* if Zerthimon's heart was one of a slave or of a rebel."

"Zerthimon surrendered to the *illithid* punishment rather than reveal his new-found strength. He *knew* that were he to show the hatred in his heart, it would serve nothing, and it would harm others that felt as he. He chose to endure the punishment and was placed within the Pillars of Silence so he might suffer for a turning."

"Lashed upon the Pillars, Zerthimon moved his mind to a place where pain could not reach, leaving his body behind. He lasted a turning, and when he was brought before Arlathii Twice-Deceased, he gave gratitude for his punishment to the *illithid* as was custom. In so doing, he proved himself a slave in the *illithid* eyes while his heart remained free."

"By enduring and quenching the fires of his hatred, he allowed Arlathii Twice-Deceased to think him weak. When the time of the Rising came, Arlathii was the first of the *illithid* to *know* death by Zerthimon's hand and die a third death."

"*Know* that the Rising of the People against the *illithid* was a thing built upon many ten-turnings of labor. Many of the People were gathered and taught in secret the ways of defeating their *illithid* masters. They were taught to shield their minds, and use them as weapons. They were taught the scripture of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom."

"Some of the People learned the nature of freedom and took it into their hearts. The *knowing* gave them strength. Others feared freedom and kept silent. But there were those that *knew* freedom and *knew* slavery, and it was their choice that the People remain chained. One of these was Vilquar."

"Vilquar saw no *freedom* in the Rising, but opportunity. He saw that the *illithid* had spawned across many of the False Worlds. Their Worlds numbered so many that their vision was turned only outwards, to all they did not already touch. Vilquar's eye saw that much took place that the *illithid* did not see. To the Rising, the *illithid* were blinded."

"Vilquar came before his master, the *illithid* Zhijitaris, with the *knowing* of the Rising. Vilquar added to his chains and offered to be their eyes against the Rising. In exchange, Vilquar asked that he be rewarded for his service. The *illithid* agreed to his contract."

"At the bonding of the contract, a dark time occurred. Many were the betrayals Vilquar committed and many were the People that the *illithids* fed upon to stem the Rising. It seemed that the Rising would die before it could occur, and the *illithid* were pleased with Vilquar's eye."

"It was near the end of this dark time when Zerthimon came to *know* Vilquar's treacheries. In *knowing* Vilquar's eye, Zerthimon forced the Rising to silence itself, so that Vilquar might think at last his treacheries had succeeded, and the Rising had fallen. He *knew* that Vilquar's eye was filled only with the reward he had been promised. He would see what he wished to see."

"With greed beating in his heart, Vilquar came upon the *illithid* Zhijitaris and spoke to his master of his success. He said that the Rising had fallen, and the *illithids* were safe to turn their eyes outwards once more. He praised their wisdom in using Vilquar's eye, and he asked them for his reward."

"In his greed-blindness, Vilquar had forgotten the *knowing* of why the People had sought freedom. He had lost the *knowing* of what slavery meant. He had forgotten what his *illithid* masters saw when they looked upon him. And so Vilquar's betrayal of the People was ended with another betrayal. Vilquar came to *know* that when Vilquar's eye has nothing left to see, Vilquar's eye is useless."

 "The *illithid* gave to Vilquar his reward, opening the cavity of his skull and devouring his brain. Vilquar's corpse was cast upon the Fields of Husks so its blood might water the poison-stemmed grasses."

Their Worlds numbered so many that their vision was turned only outwards, to all they did not already touch. Vilquar's eye saw that much took place that the *illithid* did not see. To the Rising, the *illithid* were blinded."

"Vilquar came before his master, the *illithid* Zhijitaris, with the *knowing* of the Rising. Vilquar added to his chains and offered to be their eyes against the Rising. In exchange, Vilquar asked that he be rewarded for his service. The *illithid* agreed to his contract."

"At the bonding of the contract, a dark time occurred. Many were the betrayals Vilquar committed and many were the People that the *illithids* fed upon to stem the Rising. It seemed that the Rising would die before it could occur, and the *illithid* were pleased with Vilquar's eye."

"It was near the end of this dark time when Zerthimon came to *know* Vilquar's treacheries. In *knowing* Vilquar's eye, Zerthimon forced the Rising to silence itself, so that Vilquar might think at last his treacheries had succeeded, and the Rising had fallen. He *knew* that Vilquar's eye was filled only with the reward he had been promised. He would see what he wished to see."

"With greed beating in his heart, Vilquar came upon the *illithid* Zhijitaris and spoke to his master of his success. He said that the Rising had fallen, and the *illithids* were safe to turn their eyes outwards once more. He praised their wisdom in using Vilquar's eye, and he asked them for his reward."

"In his greed-blindness, Vilquar had forgotten the *knowing* of why the People had sought freedom. He had lost the *knowing* of what slavery meant. He had forgotten what his *illithid* masters saw when they looked upon him. And so Vilquar's betrayal of the People was ended with another betrayal. Vilquar came to *know* that when Vilquar's eye has nothing left to see, Vilquar's eye is useless."

 "The *illithid* gave to Vilquar his reward, opening the cavity of his skull and devouring his brain. Vilquar's corpse was cast upon the Fields of Husks so its blood might water the poison-stemmed grasses."

"Upon the Blasted Plains, Zerthimon told Gith there cannot be two skies. In the wake of his words, came war."

"So it came to pass that the People had achieved victory over their *illithid* masters. They *knew* freedom. Yet before the green fires had died from the battlefield, Gith spoke of continuing the war. Many, still filled with the bloodlust in their hearts, agreed with her. She spoke of not merely defeating the *illithids,* but destroying all *illithids* across the planes. After the *illithids* had been exterminated, they would bring war to all other races they encountered."

"In Gith's heart, fires raged. She lived in war, and in war, she *knew* herself. All that her eyes saw, she wanted to conquer."

"Zerthimon spoke the beginnings of that which was against Gith's will. He spoke that the People already *knew* freedom. Now they should *know* themselves again and mend the damage that had been done to the People. Behind his words were many other hearts of the People who were weary of the war against the *illithid.*"

"*Know* that Gith's heart was not Zerthimon's heart on this matter. She said that the war would continue. The *illithid* would be destroyed. Their flesh would be no more. Then the People would claim the False Worlds as their own. Gith told Zerthimon that they would be under the same sky in this matter. The words were like bared steel."

"The Rising was shaped upon a slow foundation. Steel was gathered so that it might mark *illithid* flesh. A means of *knowing* the movements of the *illithids* were established, at first weak and confused, then stronger, like a child finding its voice. When the movements were *known,* then the *illithids* were observed. In observing them, their ways of the mind were *known.*"

"When the ways of the *illithid* were *known,* many of the People were gathered and taught in secret the means to shield their minds, and the way to harness their will as weapons. They were taught the scripture of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom."

"These things were not learned quickly. The *knowing* of much of the ways was slow, and in all these things, time's weight fell upon all. From the *knowing* of one's reflection in a steel blade, to the *knowing* of submerging the will, to the *knowing* of seeing itself. All of these things and more the People built upon.

This strange metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. Judging from the crude text, it appears that the bracelet works by being held by a living creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True Death,' it is touched to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is done, the minor enchantment held within the item spreads through the corpse, strengthening their bones, killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, and helping to seal minor tears in the skin.

In addition to its curative properties, the spice is also the element in several of their rites of passage... it is believed that the spice also fills in the "holes" in a person's psyche, removing doubts and giving them focus and purpose.~

The heavy gear that lies in the middle of this twisted mass of junk holds the last algebraic ruminations of Enoll Eva, the recently disintegrated Creative Director of Rubikon. Inscribed upon this twisted gear is a complex mathematical equation the modron discovered while attempting to calculate the permutations of the Rubikon maze. It is likely the presence of Limbo had an impact on his thoughts, inspiring the narrow-minded modron to think of something both brilliant and extremely dangerous.

Once "calculated" (cast), Enoll Eva's equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. During confrontations, all physical or magical attacks are doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

How it ended up inside Nordom's frame is unknown, but the rogue modron may have picked it up while gathering wayward items in the Rubikon maze.~

This tattoo is created from the four symbols of the Revolutionary League. Wearing this openly is not a good idea.

The Revolutionary League believes that all power structures should be overthrown, and they have devoted themselves to seeing that this occurs. They are the natural enemies of nearly all the other factions, and so they must move quickly when identified. The problem with this tattoo, of course, is that it immediately identifies its wearer as an Anarchist. Authority figures have a problem with this.~

Artistically, this is some of Fell's best work: although this tattoo shows the barest image of Es-Annon that you heard from the Crier of Es-Annon, you can almost *feel* the great spiraling parks and avenues of light through this intricate symbol.

This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to tell of a time when you were seeking shelter beneath the catacombs and were forced to live as a shadow might, hiding from detection by the Sigil authorities and trying to conceal yourself from the more dangerous inhabitants of the Weeping Stone catacombs.   

When worn, the tattoo makes concealing yourself easier; it allows you to shape the shadows around you like a cloak. This makes it harder for your enemies to hurt you when they see you and harder for you to find when you don't wish to be seen. It lends you a sinister appearance, however, which will cause many to shun you.

If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of hiding beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the tattoo is invoked, the ability to shape shadows around you will remain.~

It tells of you travelling down into the tombs, living in darkness, and coming to learn the nature of why the stones beneath Sigil weep. 

When worn, the tattoo makes you more resilient to cold, giving your skin the texture and strength of the weeping stone walls. In so doing, however, it also gives you a hungry gaunt look, as if you are starving.

If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of living beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the tattoo is invoked, the resistance to cold and the bonus to your lore will remain.~

In activating the tattoo, some of the memories of living on Sigil's streets will return to you, giving you more experience. Furthermore, it will give you a permanent bonus to your pick pocket skill.

This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to tell of a time when you were lost and abandoned on the streets of the Hive, barely able to make a living robbing and stealing from others you encountered. The crimes the lost incarnation committed eventually drove him to seek shelter in the Weeping Stone catacombs, where he survived for almost a year.     

When worn, the tattoo seems to bring out a survival instinct in you, making you more dexterous and resilient. If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of hiding beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous incarnation's experience.

This tattoo represents your inhumane appetite.

Occasionally, you'll have thoughts about what *other* creatures taste like, and perhaps one day you'll find out.

^NNOTE: The mechanical implications of Swallowing a creature are that they are removed from the game world. Swallowed creatures have a 25% chance each round to escape to a location near you, and will automatically escape if you Swallow another creature. Powerful creatures cannot be swallowed.~

Teaches: Dustman Embalming Techniques
Weight: 5

This worn, leather-bound tome lists diagrams and charts detailing several minor wards and enchantments. There are numerous drawings of skeletons, bones, and the manner by which they may be preserved over time. The book is much too complex for you to absorb all at once, but it looks as if you could refer to certain sections when the need arises. 

One section is mysteriously labeled "guardians." Apparently, the Dustmen animate corpses of fallen giants to serve as guardians for the Mortuary. To make them even deadlier, armoring enchantments are woven into their breastplates to help shield them from attacks. 

Another section of note describes the Dustmen's secret embalming techniques for preserving dead flesh. Apparently, with the right mix of chemicals and necromantic magic, the Dustmen can preserve a corpse for centuries.

This severed arm is as hard as a wooden club. It looks like it was severed cleanly at the shoulder (most likely by a scythe blade), and even though it looks many decades old, it is more petrified than rotted. It has an unhealthy gray pallor and is covered with scars. Intricate tattoos decorate its surface, spiraling up from the wrist all the way to the remains of the shoulder. 

When you took your severed arm to Fell, he told you about the tattoos he inscribed upon it long ago. He described your old traveling companions, as well as the significance of the symbol etched into your left shoulder. In his examination, he also unlocked some of the latent power within the arm itself, which echoed the Wretched Incarnation's demise at the hands of a trap in the depths of the Weeping Stone Catacombs.~

When compared to the tanar'ri, at least the baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of the Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the tanar'rian madness. Welcome to Hell.
