Overhauling Items in Planescape: Torment, Enhanced Edition

This mod makes changes to (eventually) all items in Planescape: Torment, Enhanced Edition, with the goal of balancing out options and making itemization more interesting at all levels of play. 

There is an item catalog available on the offical Beamdog Forums thread for this mod.
